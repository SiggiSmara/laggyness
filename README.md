# laggyness

This is a repository that contains both a collection of moving averages (MA) and other smothing algorithms of trade data as well as a testing mechanism to empirically measure the laggyness of a smothing algorithm.

In the folder research I have collected interesting code and resources for signal analysis of trading data.  Most of the cutting edge trading signals that I have come accross to date are coming from two very known trading analysts, [John Ellers](https://mesasoftware.com/) and [Alan Hull](https://alanhull.com/).  I highly recommend you study them if you are serious (and let's be honest, if you are reading this chances are that you are) about using technical signals in your trading.

John Ellers has published an incredible number of articles about trading data where he employs his engineering knowledge of signal processing to produce actionable insights.  He is the author of the Zero Lag Exponential Moving Average - [ZLEMA](https://www.mesasoftware.com/papers/ZeroLag.pdf).  Incidently you must be very careful when using other people's implementation of ZLEMA as it is very often simplified or misunderstood to a point where it has nothing to do with the original.

Alan Hull is the author of the Hull Moving Average - [HMA](https://alanhull.com/hull-moving-average) that also aims to reduce the lag of the traditional moving average.  Several known derviate moving averages such as the Hull Weighted Exponential Moving Average (Hull-WEMA) and the Exponential HMA (EHMA) should also ring bells for those of us that are studying moving averages and how to address their lag.

Both John and Alan also write about trading and trading concepts. I can only recommend to look them up.
